# food_delivery

This is a simple Flutter project.

I learn it from the youtube channel below here:
[Flutter: Food Delivery App With Laravel Backend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dAt-JMSCVQ&t=0s)
You should go there to watch and subscribe for support the author of this project.

My Admin Panel is here: [Food Delivery App Backend using Laravel](https://github.com/HoangHieuS/food_delivery_backend)
I clone it from [here](https://github.com/dbes-tech/shopping-app-backend) and change it to suit with my app.
